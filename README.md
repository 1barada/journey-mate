✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npm run nx serve api` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npm run nx build api` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npm run nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npm run nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npm run nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Explore the project graph

Run `npm run nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.

## Running with Docker

To run the application with a Dockerized database, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Containers**: First, build your application and database containers using Docker Compose. This will read your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fandreykuluev%2FDocuments%2Feliftech-school-project-2024.nosync%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D '/Users/andreykuluev/Documents/eliftech-school-project-2024.nosync/docker-compose.yml') file and build the necessary images.

```bash
docker-compose build
```

2. **Start the Containers**: Once the build process is complete, you can start the containers. This command also starts the database container configured in your `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.

3. **Verify the Containers are Running**: You can check if the containers are up and running by listing all active containers.

```bash
docker ps
```

4. **Accessing the Application**: With the containers running, you can now access your application as you normally would, through the specified ports in your `docker-compose.yml`.

5. **Stopping the Containers**: When you're done, you can stop the Docker containers by running:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
